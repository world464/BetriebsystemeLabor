A SILLY NINETEENTH CENTURY MUSIC HALL TYPE SONG

Take me down Piccadilly, Willy
Take me round Parliament Square
Take me down to London, Willy
Let me know you care.

I used to like our town. Willy
I used to like it here
But can't you see, Willy
There's more to life than beer.

I hate all your friends, Willy
I hate the bloody pub
I'm starting to think, Willy
You're no bloody good.

I need to see some life, Willy
I need to have some fun
Take me down to London, Willy
Before I bite your bum.

You're not getting more, Willy
You're not getting your way
No more fumbling about, Willy
I want to go today.



I THINK

I think I'll go to Zanzibar, And lie upon the sand,
Sit all day in a beach bar,
In that hot and happy land.

And I'Il never think of old towns,
And kids with nothing to eat,
Don't want to think of broken homes
And people in bare feet.

I think I'll go to old Palm Springs,
And play on the courses,
Ride and talk and drink large gins,
And bet upon the horses.

Don't want to here bout Bosnia,
And kids with nothing to eat,
Don't want to hear bout living in fear,
And people in bare feet.

Think I'll go to the Canton hotel,
On the front in Cannes,
They cook their lobsters very well,
I'm real big fan.

Don't want to think bout Africa,
And kids with nothing to eat,
Don't want to hear about disease
And people in bare feet.

Guess I'm just an old Romantic,
Tell me if I'm wrong,
We ye got to do something drastic,
Not just sing a song.

Tell me about what shit goes down,
And kids with nothing to eat
We gotta get up and change it round,
For people in bare feet.
